## Create Plan and Ask Questions
When the user invokes this command at the end of a planning prompt:

1. **Create a comprehensive plan** in @scratchpad.md following the planning rule structure
2. **Ask clarifying questions** to improve confidence in the plan
3. **Identify unknowns** that could impact implementation success
4. **DO NOT start implementation** - wait for questions to be answered

### Key Rules:
- Focus questions on reducing risk and improving confidence (not just gathering basic info)
- Don't skip scratchpad.md creation even if the plan seems simple
- Don't assume answers - ask even if you think you know what the user wants
