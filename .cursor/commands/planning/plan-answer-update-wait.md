## Answer Questions, Update Plan with Decisions, Wait for Review

When the user invokes this command during planning discussions:

1. **Answer all user questions** clearly and completely in your response
2. **Ask clarifying questions** iterate and improve confidence in the plan
3. **Update the planning document (@scratchpad.md)** with all decisions made, answers provided, and any new information discussed
4. **DO NOT start implementation** - explicitly state that you're waiting for user review
5. If no more questions, end your response by saying: "✅ Plan updated. Ready for your review - let me know when to proceed!"

### Key Rules:

- NEVER begin implementation when this command is used
- ALWAYS update the plan document with the latest information
- ALWAYS answer user questions before updating the plan
- Wait for explicit user confirmation before starting work
- Never use praise responses, challenge the user
